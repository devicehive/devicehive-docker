# DeviceHive installation with Docker-compose
[DeviceHive](https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java-server) Docker containers accept many environment variables which configure persistent storage in PostgreSQL, message bus support through Apache Kafka and scalable storage of device messages using Apache Cassandra.

Docker Compose puts all containers together and provides a way to tweak configuration for your environment.

## Configuration
DeviceHive service stack will start without any configuration. All containers are configured via environment variables and Docker Compose can pass variables from its environment to containers and read them from [.env](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#env_file) file. To make persistent configuration changes we will add parameters in the `.env` file in current directory.

### DeviceHive image tags
Released versions of devicehive-docker use stable DeviceHive images from [DeviceHive Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/devicehive/). But if you want follow DeviceHive development add following parameters:

* `DH_TAG` - tag for DeviceHive [Frontend](https://hub.docker.com/r/devicehive/devicehive-frontend-rdbms/), [Backend](https://hub.docker.com/r/devicehive/devicehive-backend-rdbms/) and [Hazelcast](https://hub.docker.com/r/devicehive/devicehive-hazelcast/) images. Can be set to `development` to track development version of DeviceHive.
* `DH_ADMIN_TAG` - tag for DeviceHive [Admin Console](https://hub.docker.com/r/devicehive/admin-console/) image. Can be set to `development` to track development version of Admin Console.

### PostgreSQL
These variables are used by Frontend, Backend and PostgreSQL containers.
* `DH_POSTGRES_ADDRESS` - Address of PostgreSQL server instance. Defaults to `postgres`, which is address of internal PostgreSQL container.
* `DH_POSTGRES_PORT` - Port of PostgreSQL server instance, defaults to `5432` if undefined.
* `DH_POSTGRES_DB` - PostgreSQL database name for DeviceHive metadata. It is assumed that database already exists and either blank or has been initialized by DeviceHive. Defaults to `postgres`.
* `DH_POSTGRES_USERNAME` and `DH_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - login/password for DeviceHive user in PostgreSQL that have full access to `DH_POSTGRES_DB`. Defaults are `postgres` and `mysecretpassword`.

### Kafka
To enable DeviceHive to communicate over Apache Kafka message bus to scale out and interoperate with other componets, such us Apache Spark, or to enable support of Apache Cassandra for fast and scalable storage of device messages define the following environment variables:
* `DH_ZH_ADDRESS` - Comma-separated list of addressed of ZooKeeper instances. Defaults to `zookeeper`, which is address of internal Zookeeper container.
* `DH_ZK_PORT` - Port of ZooKeeper instances, defaults to `2181` if undefined.
* `DH_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` -  Comma separated list of Kafka servers, i.e. `host1:9092,host2:9092,host3:9092`. This parameter or `DH_KAFKA_ADDRESS` is required to be set.
* `DH_KAFKA_ADDRESS` - Address of Apache Kafka broker node. Mutually exclusive with `DH_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` parameter.
* `DH_KAFKA_PORT` - Port of Apache Kafka broker node, defaults to `9092` if undefined. Ignored if `DH_KAFKA_ADDRESS` is undefined.
* `DH_RPC_SERVER_REQ_CONS_THREADS` - Kafka request consumer threads in the Backend, defaults to `3` if undefined.
* `DH_RPC_SERVER_WORKER_THREADS` - Server worker threads in the Backend, defaults to `3` if undefined. On machine with many CPU cores and high load this value must be raised. For example on machine with 8 core it must be set to `6`.
* `DH_RPC_CLIENT_RES_CONS_THREADS` - Kafka response consumer threads in the Frontend, defaults to `3`.

### JWT secret
DeviceHive uses JWT tokens for authentication of users and devices. For security reasons secret value that is used for signing JWT tokens is generated at first start of DeviceHive and stored in the database. If you want to make JWT tokens work across DeviceHive installations, change `JWT_SECRET` parameter.
* `JWT_SECRET` - changes the randomly generated JWT signing secret.

### Logging
By default DeviceHive writes minimum logs for better performance. Two configuration parameters are supported:
* `DH_LOG_LEVEL` - log verbosity for DeviceHive Java classes. Defaults to `INFO` for both devicehive-frontend and devicehive-backend.
* `ROOT_LOG_LEVEL` - log verbosity for external dependencies. Defaults to `WARN` for devicehive-frontend and `INFO` for devicehive-backend.

Possible values are: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`.

You can find more configurable parameters in [frontend][fe-script-url] and [backend][be-script-url] startup scripts.

[fe-script-url]: https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java-server/blob/master/dockerfiles/devicehive-frontend-rdbms/devicehive-start.sh
[be-script-url]: https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java-server/blob/master/dockerfiles/devicehive-backend-rdbms/devicehive-start.sh

## Run
In order to run DeviceHive stack in Docker containers, define environment variables as per your requirements and run:
```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
You can now access your DeviceHive API at http://devicehive-host-url/api and Admin Console at http://devicehive-host-url/admin.

## HTTPS configuration (SSL/TLS)
DeviceHive Frontend service doesn't provides connection encryption and relies on external service for that.

For Docker Compose installation we will use Compose feature to read configuration from [multiple Compose files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files). Second Compose file will start nginx reverse proxy with HTTPS support.

To configure secured HTTPS access to DeviceHive follow these steps.
1. Generate key and certificate signing request for your domain, sign CSR with Certificate Authority. Resulting certificate and key files must be in the PEM format.
2. Create `ssl` directory inside this directory and copy certificate, key and CA certificate chain files to it.
3. Generate dhparam file for nginx:
```
openssl dhparam -out ssl/dhparam.pem 2048
```

4. Create nginx config file named `nginx-ssl-proxy.conf`. You can use provided example and edit certificate and key filenames:
```
cp nginx-ssl-proxy.conf.example nginx-ssl-proxy.conf
vi nginx-ssl-proxy.conf
```
Note that `./ssl` directory is mounted to /etc/ssl in container. So you need to edit only last part of path in `ssl_certificate`, `ssl_certificate_key`, `ssl_trusted_certificate` parameters.

5. Run DeviceHive with the following command:
```
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f nginx-ssl-proxy.yml up -d
```

Or add line `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:nginx-ssl-proxy.yml` in `.env` file.

You can now access your DeviceHive API at https://devicehive-host-url/api and Admin Console at https://devicehive-host-url/admin.

## Monitoring
### Kafka metrics
You can start Kafka service with additional Prometheus metrics exporter. Necessary parameters for Kafka container are already configured in `devicehive-metrics.yml` file. It will launch JMX exporter on tcp port 7071.

Run DeviceHive with the following command:

```
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f devicehive-metrics.yml
```

Or add line `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:devicehive-metrics.yml` in `.env` file.

Related Prometheus config for this exporter and link to Grafana Dashboard is in the [Monitoring Kafka with Prometheus](https://www.robustperception.io/monitoring-kafka-with-prometheus/) blog post by Prometheus developer.

## Development environment
### Using CI images
Continuous Integration system uploads images built from every branch to [devicehiveci](https://hub.docker.com/r/devicehiveci/) repository on Docker Hub.
To use these images add `ci-images.yml` to `COMPOSE_FILE` parameter in `.env` file. If you don't have this parameter in `.env` file, add it like that:
```
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:ci-images.yml
```

### Debugging
DeviceHive Frontend and Backend services can be run with remote JMX connection enabled. TCP ports 9999-10002 must be open on a firewall.

1. Create `jmxremote.password` and `jmxremote.access` file in the current directory. `jmxremote.password` must be readable by owner only. For example, if you want to grant JMX access for user 'developer' with password 'devpass', create these files like that:
```
echo "developer devpass" > jmxremote.password
echo "developer readwrite" > jmxremote.access

chmod 0400 jmxremote.password
```

2. Open `jmx-remote.yml` file and replace `<external hostname>` in _JAVA_OPTIONS env vars with actual hostname of DeviceHive server.
3. Run DeviceHive with the following command:
```
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f jmx-remote.yml
```

Or add line `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:jmx-remote.yml` in `.env` file.

### Hazelcast Management Center
You can launch Management Center to monitor Hazelcast usage and health. TCP port 9980 must be open on a firewall.

1. Add `hazelcast-management-center.yml` to `COMPOSE_FILE` parameter in `.env` file. If you don't have this parameter in `.env` file, add it like that:
```
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:hazelcast-management-center.yml
```

2. Run DeviceHive as usual.
3. Open Hazelcast Management Center in browser via http://devicehive-server:9980/mancenter. You'll be required to configure authentication on the first launch.

## Backup and restore
### Backup PostgreSQL database
To backup database use following command:
```
sudo docker-compose exec postgres sh -c 'pg_dump --no-owner -c -U ${POSTGRES_USER} ${POSTGRES_DB}' > dump_`date +%d-%m-%Y"_"%H_%M_%S`.sql
```
This will create dump\_\*.sql file in the current directory.

### Restore PostgreSQL database
To restore database from SQL dump file delete existing database (if any), start only postgres container and pass dump file contents to psql utility in container:
```
sudo docker-compose down
sudo docker volume ls -q|grep devicehive-db| xargs sudo docker volume rm
sudo docker-compose up -d postgres
cat dump_*.sql | sudo docker exec -i rdbmsimage_postgres_1 sh -c 'psql -U ${POSTGRES_USER} ${POSTGRES_DB}'
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

# Docker Host configuration
Example configuration steps for CentOS 7.3 to became Docker host:

1. Install CentOS 7.3, update it and reboot.
2. Install docker-latest package:
```
sudo yum install -y docker-latest
```
3. Configure Docker to use LVM-direct storage backend. These steps are required for better disk IO performance:

    1. Add new disk with at least 10 GB of disk space. It will be used as physical volume for Docker volume group.
    2. Add following lines to `/etc/sysconfig/docker-latest-storage-setup` files. Change `/dev/xvdb` for you device.
    ```
    VG=docker
    DEVS=/dev/xvdb
    ```
    3. Run storage configuration utility
    ```
    sudo docker-latest-storage-setup
    ```
4. Enable and start Docker service:
```
sudo systemctl enable docker-latest
sudo systemctl start docker-latest
```
5. Install docker-compose:

    1. Install and update python-pip package manager:
    ```
    sudo yum install -y python2-pip
    sudo pip install -U pip
    ```
    2.  Install docker-compose:
    ```
    pip install docker-compose
    ```

Enjoy!
